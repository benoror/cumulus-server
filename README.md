# cumulus-server

**Cumulus** aims to provide a centralized way for sharing health records in a way that a diversity of systems (a.k.a. consumers) can **pull & push** patient data in an organized way, thus keeping the health records updated and relevant throughout different healthcare providers and the patient itself.

_TL;DR;_ Digital health information should follow the patient throughout modern healthcare providers, and not the other way around
